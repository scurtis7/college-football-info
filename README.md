# College Football Information

College Football Information is an application with a little bit of everything.  It's a Spring Boot, Angular application
utilizing reactive streams with Webflux and R2DBC database driver.  It combines two things that I love, college football 
and writing software.

The application will utilize the [College Football Data API](https://api.collegefootballdata.com/api/docs/?url=/api-docs.json#/)
to provide current and relevant college football information.
